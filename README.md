# Snowstorm-Screensaver
An old screensaver that I made when I was young and still learning. Still, I find it very peaceful to watch.

You can turn it into a screensaver by just changing the exe's extention to .scr. Windows has a specification for the arguments it will pass to screensavers,
/c to show options, /s to run the screensaver, I think /p to preview, but I don't currently support that one.
